Employee Performance Analysis Dashboard - Project Documentation
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of employee performance data using Microsoft Power BI, providing insights into performance metrics, budget allocations, and comparative analysis across departments and teams.
1. Approach and Rationale
Dashboard Design Strategy
The dashboard was designed to provide HR managers and department heads with clear, actionable insights through:

Comparative Analysis: Performance metrics are shown relative to department, team, and organization averages rather than absolute values
Visual Storytelling: Charts and graphs tell a clear story about employee performance trends
Interactive Elements: Filters and slicers allow users to explore data by department, team, or individual employee
Multi-Level Insights: Information flows from organizational overview to individual employee details
